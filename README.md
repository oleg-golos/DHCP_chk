# Windows DHCP Server Inconsistency Checker
This script checks two Windows DHCP servers in failover relationship for inconsistencies and sends report if it finds any. I wrote it as a temporary alerting solution for transient bug in Windows Server 2012 DHCP server which was causing corrupted DHCP reservations.
